      <h4 class="game-description">
        GTA 5 is number 5 on my list. This game brings so much nostolgia when I
        play it. This game was the first real big games I ever played. I
        remember playing it for the first time on the xbox 360. I love this game
        the story was interesting, the freedom you had when exploring the game
        world was great, and the graphics during release was one of the best in
        the game world at the time. That being said as much as I loved the game
        I did have problems with it. After the story is completed there really
        is not much you can do unless you play GTA Online. I wish they had added
        the ability to form your own heists, or added more ways to enjoy the
        game after it's completion. Even though there were a couple missions in
        the game I found to be pretty boring the game was still great and with
        the wonder that is GTA Online this game holds a solid spot at number 5
        on this list.

      <h4 class="game-description">
        This game was a very good and fun game to have played. I loved the open
        world and the freedom you had to explore it. It brought you back to the
        old western world. I loved the fact that you could create your own path
        based off the action that you took while playing through the game. would
        you be a good or bad person. The graphics were also something worth
        noting This game was great and definitly deserves a spot at number 4 on
        this list.

      <h3 class="game-title">Number 3: The Last of Us</h3>

      >
      <h4 class="game-description">
        The last of Us was a game that suprised me in a lot of ways. This was
        the first zombie type game that I actually really liked. The story was
        great and being able to see Joel's and Ellie's relationship grow from
        them not liking each other at all to Joel viewing Ellie like his own
        daughter was great. I liked the exploring aspect of the game and the
        graphics were once again amazing. This game is definitly among my
        favorites and places it at number 3 on the list.

      >
      <h4 class="game-description">
        Now speaking of God of War 2018 I could not continue the list without
        also listing God of War 2018's Sequal "God of War Ragnarok". This game
        being the sequal to God of war 2018 brought high expectations for this
        game. Luckily for everyone those expectations were met. God of war
        Ragnarok saw a massive game overhaul. From the attacking moves,
        defenseive moves, to overall game mechanics.
        <br />
        <br />
        While the different attack and defensive mechanics took some getting
        used to I still really loved the game. From graphics, story, gameplay,
        and my peronal favorite the variety of enemies. The enemies finally had
        variety and it was very fun learning their attacks and having to come up
        with different stratagies to beat them. This game was my personal game
        of the year for 2022.
        <br />
        <br />
        That being said there were once again aspects of this game that I wish
        were different. The major thing I wish was different was the amount of
        hand holding this game has with puzzles. Atreus constantly giving you
        the answers to them in the first 5 seconds. It was extremely annoying
        and took away from the experience of figuring things out. I believe
        having an option to turn this dialuge off would have been amazing. The
        second problem I have with the game is the difficulty of the enemies.
        Setting The difficulty to give me god of war I still found the enemies
        to be a lot easier than in prequal. The story of the game is great
        however when meeting Angreboda this section of the game was extremely
        boring and was a major let down. That being said this game is still
        amazing however, I find myself liking the prequal better.

      <h4 class="game-description">
        The god of War series one of the most loved Playstation franchise game
        series to have been created. This of course was not without reason. The
        story of Kratos and the journey of his ups and downs could be an entire
        website long.
        <br />
        <br />
        Focusing strictly on the God of War 2018 game I would say this is my
        favorite game. From the graphics, to the gameplay, to the story, and the
        replayability of the game. Nearly everything about the game was amazing.
        I have played the game three different times and with the ability to use
        new game plus it made fun to have the enemies be even more difficult
        than the first play through. I'm also not the only person who thinks so.
        God of War 2018 won the game of the year award in 2018.
        <br />
        <br />
        If I had to choose my favorite thing about this game. It would be seeing
        the growth that Kratos has gone through. From a revenge fueled god to
        someone who lost his wife and tries his hardest to become someone better
        and take care of his only son named Atreus. If there was one thing I had
        to choose that could have been better it would be the variety of
        different bosses that you had to face. Often-times you would face a
        troll, draugr, or witches. While the enemies were still fun to face I
        often felt myself wanting a new challenge instead of the same old troll
        with the only difference being their colors. That being said this game
        is still a truly beautiful masterpeice, and if for some reason you have
        not played it please do!
